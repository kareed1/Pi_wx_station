# Pi_wx_station
Raspberry Pi weather station script

File is ran using: sudo python3 filename.py.
Script is only set to run 1x, then it writes output to csv file.
To run it more than once, I set it as a cron job (see cron job script).
Code forked from https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station
